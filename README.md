**A bit about Stable Diffusion**

Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input.Stable diffusion is based on a particular type of diffusion model called latent diffusion, which was proposed in high-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models (LDM).

General diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained to denoise random Gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of interest, such as an image.

Diffusion models have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results for generating image data. However, one downside of diffusion models is that the reverse denoising process is slow. In addition, these models consume a lot of memory because they operate in pixel space, which becomes unreasonably expensive when generating high-resolution images. Therefore, it is challenging to train and use these models for inference.

Latent diffusion can reduce the memory and compute complexity by applying the diffusion process over a lower dimensional latent space, instead of using the actual pixel space. This is the key difference between standard diffusion and latent diffusion models: in latent diffusion, the model is trained to generate latent (compressed) representations of the images.

**Gradio -> Helps Build of AI Images**

Gradio is an open-source Python framework that makes it easy to build quick interfaces like chatbots, voice-activated bots, and even full-fledged web applications to share your machine learning model, API or data science workflow with clients or collaborators. With Gradio, you can build quick demos and share them, all in Python with just a few lines of code.
